# Manticore Search Docker image

This is the git repo of official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/manticoresearch/manticore/) for [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch).

Manticore Search is an easy to use open source fast database for search. It helps thousands of companies from small to large, such as Craigslist, to search and filter petabytes of text data on a single or hundreds of nodes, do stream full-text filtering, add auto-complete, spell correction, more-like-this, faceting and other search-related technologies to their websites and applications.

The default configuration includes a sample Real-Time index and listens on the default ports:
  * `9306` for connections from a MySQL client
  * `9308` for connections via HTTP
  * `9312` for connections via a binary protocol (e.g. in case you run a cluster)

The image comes with libraries for easy indexing data from MySQL, PostgreSQL XML and CSV files.

# How to run Manticore Search Docker image

## Quick usage

The below is the simplest way to start Manticore in a container and log in to it via mysql client:

```bash
docker run --name manticore --rm -d manticoresearch/manticore && sleep 3 && docker exec -it manticore mysql && docker stop manticore
```

When you exit from the mysql client it stops and removes the container, so **use it only for testing / sandboxing purposes**. See below how to use it in production.

The image comes with a sample index which can be loaded like this:

```mysql
mysql> source /sandbox.sql
```

Also the mysql client has in history several sample queries that you can run on the above index, just use Up/Down keys in the client to see and run them.

## Production use


### Ports and mounting points

For data persistence `/var/lib/manticore/` should be mounted to local storage or other desired storage engine.

```bash
docker run --name manticore -v $(pwd)/data:/var/lib/manticore -p 127.0.0.1:9306:9306 -p 127.0.0.1:9308:9308 -d manticoresearch/manticore
```

Configuration file inside the instance is located at `/etc/manticoresearch/manticore.conf`. For custom settings, this file should be mounted to your own configuration file.

The ports are 9306/9308/9312 for SQL/HTTP/Binary, expose them depending on how you are going to use Manticore. For example:

```bash
docker run --name manticore -v $(pwd)/manticore.conf:/etc/manticoresearch/manticore.conf -v $(pwd)/data:/var/lib/manticore/ -p 127.0.0.1:9306:9306 -p 127.0.0.1:9308:9308 -d manticoresearch/manticore
```

Make sure to remove `127.0.0.1:` if you want the ports to be available for external hosts.

### Manticore Columnar Library

The docker image doesn't include [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar) which has to be used if you need:
* columnar storage
* secondary indexes

but you can easily enable it in runtime by using environment variable `EXTRA=1`, i.e. `docker run -e EXTRA=1 ... manticoresearch/manticore`. It will then download and install the library and put it to the data dir (which is normally mapped as a volume in production). Next time you run the container the library will be already there, hence it won't be downloaded again unless you change the Manticore Search version.

### Docker-compose

In many cases you might want to use Manticore together with other images specified in a docker-compose YAML file. Here is the minimal recommended specification for Manticore Search in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:
  manticore:
    container_name: manticore
    image: manticoresearch/manticore
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:9306:9306
      - 127.0.0.1:9308:9308
    ulimits:
      nproc: 65535
      nofile:
         soft: 65535
         hard: 65535
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    environment:
      - EXTRA=1
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/manticore
#      - ./manticore.conf:/etc/manticoresearch/manticore.conf # uncommment if you use a custom config
```

Besides using the exposed ports 9306 and 9308 you can log into the instance by running `docker-compose exec manticore mysql`.

### HTTP protocol

Manticore is accessible via HTTP on ports 9308 and 9312. You can map either of them locally and connect with curl:

```bash
docker run --name manticore -p 9308:9308 -d manticoresearch/manticore
```

Create a table:
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9308/sql' -d 'mode=raw&query=CREATE TABLE testrt ( title text, content text, gid integer)'
```
Insert a document:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9308/json/insert' -d'{"index":"testrt","id":1,"doc":{"title":"Hello","content":"world","gid":1}}'
```

Perform a simple search:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9308/json/search' -d '{"index":"testrt","query":{"match":{"*":"hello world"}}}'
```

### Logging

By default, Manticore logs to `/dev/stdout`, so you can watch the log on the host with:

```bash
docker logs manticore
```

If you want to get log of your queries the same way you can do it by passing environment variable `QUERY_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true`.

### Multi-node cluster with replication

Here is a simple `docker-compose.yml` for defining a two node cluster:

```yaml
version: '2.2'

services:

  manticore-1:
    image: manticoresearch/manticore
    restart: always
    ulimits:
      nproc: 65535
      nofile:
         soft: 65535
         hard: 65535
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    environment:
      - EXTRA=1
    networks:
      - manticore
  manticore-2:
    image: manticoresearch/manticore
    restart: always
    ulimits:
      nproc: 65535
      nofile:
        soft: 65535
        hard: 65535
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
    environment:
      - EXTRA=1
    networks:
      - manticore
networks:
  manticore:
    driver: bridge
```
* Start it: `docker-compose up`
* Create a cluster with a table:
  ```mysql
  $ docker-compose exec manticore-1 mysql

  mysql> CREATE TABLE testrt ( title text, content text, gid integer);

  mysql> CREATE CLUSTER posts;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.24 sec)

  mysql> ALTER CLUSTER posts ADD testrt;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

  MySQL [(none)]> exit
  Bye
  ```
* Join to the the cluster on the 2nd instance and insert smth to the table:
  ```mysql
  $ docker-compose exec manticore-2 mysql

  mysql> JOIN CLUSTER posts AT 'manticore-1:9312';
  mysql> INSERT INTO posts:testrt(title,content,gid)  VALUES('hello','world',1);
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

  MySQL [(none)]> exit
  Bye
  ```

* If you now go back to the first instance you'll see the new record:
  ```mysql
  $ docker-compose exec manticore-1 mysql

  MySQL [(none)]> select * from testrt;
  +---------------------+------+-------+---------+
  | id                  | gid  | title | content |
  +---------------------+------+-------+---------+
  | 3891565839006040065 |    1 | hello | world   |
  +---------------------+------+-------+---------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  MySQL [(none)]> exit
  Bye
  ```

## Memory locking and limits

It's recommended to overwrite the default ulimits of docker for the Manticore instance:

```bash
 --ulimit nofile=65536:65536
```

For the best performance, Manticore tables' components can be locked into memory. When Manticore is run under Docker, the instance requires additional privileges to allow memory locking. The following options must be added when running the instance:

```bash
  --cap-add=IPC_LOCK --ulimit memlock=-1:-1
```

## Configuring Manticore Search with Docker

If you want to run Manticore with your custom config containing indexes definition you will need to mount the configuration to the instance:

```bash
docker run --name manticore -v $(pwd)/manticore.conf:/etc/manticoresearch/manticore.conf -v $(pwd)/data/:/var/lib/manticore -p 127.0.0.1:9306:9306 -d manticoresearch/manticore
```

Take into account that Manticore search inside the container is run under user `manticore`. Performing operations with tables (like creating or rotating plain indexes) should be also done under `manticore`. Otherwise the files will be created under `root` and the search daemon won't have rights to open them. For example here is how you can rotate all plain indexes:

```bash
docker exec -it manticore gosu manticore indexer --all --rotate
```

### Environment variables

You can also set individual `searchd` and `common` configuration settings using Docker environment variables.  

The settings must be prefixed with their section name, for example to change value of setting `mysql_version_string` in section `searchd` the variable must be named `searchd_mysql_version_string`:


```bash
docker run --name manticore  -p 127.0.0.1:9306:9306  -e searchd_mysql_version_string='5.5.0' -d manticoresearch/manticore
```

In case of `listen` directive, you can pass using Docker variable `searchd_listen` new listening interfaces in addition to the default ones. Multiple interfaces can be declared separated by semi-colon ("|").
For listening only on network address, the `$ip` (retrieved internally from `hostname -i`) can be used as address alias.

For example `-e searchd_listen='9316:http|9307:mysql|$ip:5443:mysql_vip'` will add an additional SQL interface on port 9307, a SQL VIP on 5443 running only on the instance IP  and HTTP on port 9316, beside the defaults on 9306 and 9308, respectively.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -p 1188:9307  -e searchd_mysql_version_string='5.5.0' -e searchd_listen='9316:http|9307:mysql|$ip:5443:mysql_vip'  manticore

```

### Running under non-root
By default, the main Manticore process `searchd` is running under user `manticore` inside the container, but the script which runs on starting the container is run under your default docker user which in most cases is `root`. If that's not what you want you can use `docker ... --user manticore` or `user: manticore` in docker compose yaml to make everything run under `manticore`. Read below about possible volume permissions issue you can get and how to solve it.

# Building with buildx

To build multi-arch images, we use the buildx plugin. Before building, follow these steps:

```bash
    docker buildx create  --name manticore_build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
    docker buildx use manticore_build
    docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

Once the above steps are completed, run the following `build` and `push` commands:

```bash
docker buildx build --push --build-arg DEV=1 --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --tag  manticoresearch/manticore:$BUILD_TAG . 
```

# Troubleshooting

### Permissions issue with a mounted volume

In case you are running Manticore Search docker under non-root (using `docker ... --user manticore` or `user: manticore` in docker compose yaml), you can face a permissions issue, for example:
```bash
FATAL: directory /var/lib/manticore write error: failed to open /var/lib/manticore/tmp: Permission denied
```

or in case you are using `-e EXTRA=1`:

```bash
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/var/lib/manticore/.mcl/’: Permission denied
```

This can happen because the user which is used to run processes inside the container may have no permissions to modify the directory you have mounted to the container. To fix it you can `chown` or `chmod` the mounted directory. If you run the container under user `manticore` you need to do:
```bash
chown -R 999:999 data
```

since user `manticore` has ID 999 inside the container.
